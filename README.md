# MLPSandbox
MPLSandbox is an out-of-the-box multi-programming language sandbox designed to provide unified and comprehensive feedback from compiler and analysis tools for LLMs.




## Note
We are working hard to refactor and improve the open-source version of MLPSandbox to closely match the functionality of the version used internally by Meituan LLM Team.
